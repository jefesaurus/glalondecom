===========

This is my custom WordPress theme that I use on my portfolio/project site.
It probably doesn't follow any of WP's guidelines for themes, but it suits my needs.

It makes pretty heavy use of CSS3 and no use of JS.
I tried to make it somewhat reponsive, so it is at least useable on iPhones and stuff.
